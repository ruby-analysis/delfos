# This existence of these `Unstubbing` modules are an unfortunate side effect of trying to
# test something that redefines methods.  In order to not call the logging
# defined in `Delfos::Patching::MethodOverride#setup` multiple times we have to keep track of
# and remove the method definitions and replace with the original definition
# (or as close to the original as possible).
#
# If there is a better way to test Delfos::Patching without doing this then
# please suggest or replace with a cleaner alternative
